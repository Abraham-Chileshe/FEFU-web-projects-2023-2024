            <h3>What is Netflix?</h3>
            <p><b>Netflix</b> is an <u>American</u> subscription video on-demand over-the-top <strong>streaming service</strong> owned and operated by Netflix, Inc. that primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.[6]                Launched on January 16, 2007, nearly a decade after Netflix, Inc. began its DVD-by-mail service, Netflix is the most-subscribed video on demand streaming media service, with 238.39 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries.[7] By 2022, original productions accounted for half of its library in the United States and the namesake company had ventured into other categories, such as video game publishing via its eponymous service.</p>
